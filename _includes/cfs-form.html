{% capture cfs_part_one %}
Currently, we accept talk proposals in both **English** and **Italian** (if you are confident with both, use English). 

You can submit:

* either **30-min** or **50-min talks** (Q&A should be included in this time);
* other session lengths and formats can be discussed. If interested, please [reach out](mailto:https://italiancpp.org/).

Talks are intended **in-person** only. We are not accepting remote-only nor pre-recorded sessions.

**Submissions deadline is April 2 with decisions sent by April 9.**

The conference is free to attend and not-for-profit, thus **we can't cover your travel exepenses/accommodation**. However, we are collecting fundings for inviting speakers, staff, and sponsors to a pre-conference special dinner (not confirmed yet). 

You should submit a talk about anything you think itâ€™s worth sharing with the *C++ Community*.

{% capture cfs_part_two %}
For example, have you learned something interesting about C++, maybe a new technique possible in C++17/20? Or perhaps you have implemented something cool related to C++, maybe a new C++ library.

As C++ developers, C++ is important to us. However, we are happy to host talks on other topics that can inspire us.

Our events abide by the Italian [C++ Community Code of Conduct](https://github.com/italiancpp/code-of-conduct/blob/master/code_of_conduct.md).

### Voting and decisions ###

You can submit more than one talk.

If the number of submissions exceeds the event capacity, we open a poll.

The conference has no real dedicated program committee, all attendees of the past, the Italian C++ Community staff and this year speakers are included in this voting. Each vote is between 0 â€“ 5 points per talk. Visible in the voting tool are usually only the talk info (title, abstract, notes only if important for the voting), staff members only are able to see also the speaker name and bio. More details on this once the voting begins.

Final decision is then made once the voting deadline has passed.
