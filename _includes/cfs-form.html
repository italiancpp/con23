<div  class="narrow">
{% markdown %}
Currently, we accept talk proposals in both **English** and **Italian** (if you are confident with both, use English). 

You can submit:

* **30-min** or **50-min talks**,
* interactive workshops hosted on any platforms (e.g. Discord or Google Meet),
* other session lengths and formats can be discussed. If interested, please reach out.

**Submissions deadline is April 11 with decisions sent by April 20.**

You can submit more than one talk.

You should submit a talk about anything you think itâ€™s worth sharing with the *C++ Community*.

For example, have you learned something interesting about C++, maybe a new technique possible in C++17/20? Or perhaps you have implemented something cool related to C++, maybe a new C++ library.

As C++ developers, C++ is important to us. However, we are happy to host talks on other topics that can inspire us.

Our events abide by the Italian [C++ Community Code of Conduct](https://github.com/italiancpp/code-of-conduct/blob/master/code_of_conduct.md).

### Voting and decisions ###

When the conference gets more talks than the capacity (e.g. 10), we open a poll.

The conference has no real dedicated program committee, all attendees of the past, the Italian C++ Community staff and this year speakers are included in this voting. Each vote is between 0 â€“ 5 points per talk. Visible in the voting tool are usually only the talk info (title, abstract, notes only if important for the voting), staff members only are able to see also the speaker name and bio. More details on this once the voting begins.

Final decision is then made once the voting deadline has passed.{% endmarkdown %}
