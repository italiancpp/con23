The Italian C++ Conference is the biggest and most successful event series organized by the Italian C++ Community.  
Here professionals, companies and students meet to share experience about C++ development and practices.

📺 The Italian C++ Conference 2021 is an online-only event, hosted on the Remo platform, consisting of live sessions and virtual networking. 

**Why you cannot miss it:**

⭐ **never seen before** live keynote by *Sean Parent* (Sr. Principal Scientist, Adobe Photoshop)
🎙️ **12 live tech talks** about C++ development and practices
⁉️ live chat Q&A
💬 all day long **virtual networking**
🆓 **free** to attend
♥️ **organized with passion** by the Italian C++ Community

The first **Italian C++ Conference** took place in [2016](https://www.italiancpp.org/event/conference-2016/) and hosted **100+ attendees**.

The last “in-person” Italian C++ Conference was organized in [2019](https://www.italiancpp.org/itcppcon19) and hosted **~240 people** with a special keynote by **Andrei Alexandrescu**, 7 sponsors and 10 talks.

Last year, in [2020](https://www.italiancpp.org/itcppcon20), the COVID emergency challenged us to adapt and to learn from scratch a new way to organize events and interact with people. We made it and we organized a virtual event with **415 check-ins** and **250 keynote live-viewers**.

 
We are all pioneering the age of virtual conferences. Will you join us?
