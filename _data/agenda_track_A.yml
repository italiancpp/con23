  item: "Improving Compilation Times: Tools & Techniques"
  speaker: 
    -Vittorio Romeo
  abstract: "\"Modules will solve everything\", people say -- some optimistically, others sarcastically. However, modules are far from reaching real-world maturity, and it is still not certain whether they will improve compilation times in every situation and how costly it will be to migrate a large codebase. Do we have to suffer with excruciating compilation times until we are able to migrate to modules? Not at all!
  
If you are interested in learning about practical tools and techniques to improve compilation times on codebases of any size, *today*, this talk is for you! We will cover:

- How to accurately benchmark the compilation time of a codebase and detect bottlenecks;
- Enabling precompiled headers in CMake, leveraging the \"reuse from\" feature;
- Automatically transforming your build into a \"unity build\";
- When to selectively replace heavyweight standard library headers;
- General techniques to reduce physical dependencies between components."

  speaker:
    - Chris Ryan
  abstract: "Join me on a tour of some of the more useful C++ Design Patterns that you will likely see and need to know. Knowing how to use Design Patterns will help your code's robustness and will enable others to better read your code and intent.
When designing and writing code you will see similar techniques and patterns repeatedly used throughout different systems and programs. An experienced developer saves these tried and true, well debugged techniques in their personal toolbox for later use.

Others have also noticed these patterns in designs. Some of the more useful techniques have been documented and organized in books like \"Design Patterns\" by the \"Gang of Four\" (aka \"GoF\"), \"Code Complete\" by Steve McConnell,... As coding paradigms have changed new design patterns have evolved.

Other design patterns have worked their way into common use through usefulness. Techniques have been given names for quick reference and as a shorthand in the exchange of ideas. Think of Design Patterns as a mental standard library of building blocks for your designs."

  speaker: 
    - Jonathan MÃ¼ller
  abstract: " 
C++ is a big language -- the upcoming C++23 standard will be over 2000 pages long. This talk will cover some obscure features you might not know. We will cover strange syntax like commutative array indexing and complicated declarators, surprising cases of undefined behavior in frequently used operators contrasted with a surprising lack of undefined behavior in operations that really shouldn't work, overlooked language facilities -- some of them actually useful, and half-forgotten standard library functions -- some of them for good reason.

For each feature, we will talk about the what, the why, and how you can use it to write better (or much, *much* worse) C++ programs."

  item: "Optimization Design Patterns"
  speaker: 
    - Mike Shah
  abstract:  "\"Premature optimization is the root of all evil\" is a saying credited to Donald Knuth that speaks to many programmers with experience -- nut anecdotally I have observed folks overlooking the next sentence stating: \"Yet we should not pass up our opportunities in that critical 3%\". In this talk, the audience will be introduced to some common optimization design patterns. I will discuss precomputation, lazy versus eager evaluation, batching, caching, specialization, hinting, hashing, and using your compiler among 'optimization design patterns' that every programmer should be aware of. Examples will be demonstrated in Modern C++, and the goal is for the audience to leave feeling comfortable implementing each optimization design pattern to improve performance of their code."

  item: "A case for non-virtual virtual inheritance"
  speaker: 
    - Marco Manino
  abstract: " 
In the context of DSP, C++20's `std::span` offers a great abstraction, allowing the user to write a code once, that can work both at compile-time and at run-time.
However, oftentimes data processing needs some memory space to store transient results or cache intermediate values. While `constexpr` memory allocation are allowed in C++20, functions which explicitly allocate are cumbersome for embedded systems, as the size of the allocation can't be checked at compile-time for correctness.
In this talk I will try to explore first some design alternatives to give the user more control on where to store transient data, and then a case for non-virtual virtual inheritance as a means to share buffers among similar algorithms, together with some metaprogramming tricks to ease their usage.

  item: "Things you can learn by the C++ standard library"
  speaker: 
    - Davide Bianchi
  abstract: "C++ programmers often complain about the lack of features, featuring in the standard library. Many community favorites - like optional, variant and byte - took years to come in; networking is yet unreachable and graphics is nowhere to be seen.
But taking a closer look at the algorithms and data structures that are already in the standard, it is easy to witness a world full of clever solutions and efficient ideas: from what drives the STL containers, to clever implementations of algorithm's functions down to some of the tricks that ensures that 0-cost abstractions are, indeed, free.
In this talk we will present 1 container and 4 famous algorithm that are taught in AIV during the first year, discuss how they work and how they are implemented in the standard library and show how those algorithm are used in the context of video-game programming."
