  speaker: "Alberto Bignotti"
  abstract: "During the evolution of a software I had the need to send notification messages to users and receive messages from the user to the app. I studied telegram, created a Bot and implemented a C++ library that communicates with users. The object of the session is not how to use my library, but to give ideas so that everyone can create their own."

  item: "Understanding values categories in C++"
  speaker: "Kris van Rens"
  abstract: "In C++ today, do you know what an xvalue is? Or a prvalue? Why would you want to know? Because it matters! In C++, each expression is characterized by a value category. These value categories are used to describe parts of the C++ standard, and are often used in books and articles. You might have heard of terms like 'lvalue' or 'rvalue', which are the most commonly known ones. Over the years, changes to the C++ language changed the meaning of value categories. This means a lot of information about value categories is outdated or just plain wrong. In this talk, I will explain what expression value categories are in today's C++ standard. It turns out that knowledge about value categories can really be beneficial. Not only will it enrich your understanding of C++ in general, it will deepen your understanding of mechanisms like move semantics. Also, it can help you to make better choices about code. These choices can then leverage language rules to enable compilers to generate efficient code without redundant copies. Other, related topics that will be covered: copy elision, return value optimization, temporary materialization."

  speaker: "Marco Arena & Mattia Verasani"
  abstract: "ONNX is an open source format built to represent machine learning and deep learning models. The project enables AI developers to use models with a variety of frameworks, tools, runtimes, and compilers. The development of ONNX is driven by a community of partners including Microsoft, Facebook, NVIDIA and Mathworks.ONNXRuntime is an open source project driven by Microsoft which provides an optimized implementation of all the standard ONNX operators for the CPU. It supports a plenty of acceleration targets like cuDNN by NVIDIA and MKL-DNNL by Intel, and it exposes the right abstraction and runtime support for custom accelerators and runtimes. In this session you'll hear about ONNX and ONNXRuntime, and you will see some practical examples of using ONNX models in C++ with ONNXRuntime."
