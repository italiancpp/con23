He joined the C++ standards effort in 2000, and has since written circa 170 proposal papers. Among numerous other contributions, he is responsible for introducing such now-standard C++ library features as cbegin/cend, common_type, gcd/lcm, void_t, and <cmath>’s mathematical special functions, as well as the headers <random> and <ratio>. He has also significantly impacted such C++ core language features as alias templates, contextual conversions, variable templates, static_assert, and operator<=> (the C++20 “spaceship operator”)."

  topic: "A bird's-eye view of template C++"
  description: "C++ is a multi-paradigm programming language. This means it lends itself to solve a specific problem in various forms or styles. One of those forms or styles is object-oriented programming, with which C++ is often identified. Another strong suit of C++ is the support for generic programming and template metaprogramming. In this session we are going to look at modern-day C++ templates, and how we can use them effectively. Template programming sometimes has the reputation of being hard to understand and adopt, which surely may be the case for highly advanced usage. However, we will see that templates can be used for a myriad of purposes, which often have a low barrier to entry. Command of templates will greatly improve your efficiency and productivity as a C++ programmer. The topics we are going to cover include: generic programming, metaprogramming, type traits, static/compile-time polymorphism, variadic templates, and much more. Not only will we look at the state of templates in C++17, we will also address what C++20 and the future has to offer. Join me in this session exploring the wonderful and interesting world of C++ templates, and improve or refresh your knowledge."
